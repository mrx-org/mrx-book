# MRX: Pulseq

> **TODO**
>
> A rudimentary pulseq API is currently included in [`toolapi`].
> It should be extracted into its own package by copying `pulseq-zero`.
> This package should be `toolapi` - compatible while being able to write
> `.seq` files without having dependencies outside of MRX.
> 
> Contrary to `pulseq-zero`, `MRX: pulseq` will initially not be differentiable
> until support has landed in the `toolapi`.
